# Learning-SQL-Oreilly-Book-by-Alan-Beaulieu

I am reading this book by Alan Beaulieu to learn SQL. I am actually quite familiar with SQL already, but wanted to learn it from the very basic level to advance level, hence purchased this book. 
This repository contains the queries I wrote while reading this book. It contains practice queries and exercise solutions given in the book.
